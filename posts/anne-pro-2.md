I got the Anne Pro 2 in white with gateron blue switches.

## Nice stock keycaps

The Anne Pro 2 comes with PBT keycaps; they're shinethrough so that you can see the RGB lighting shine through the characters printed on the keycaps.

I appreciate that these stock keycaps use a normal font - it's not super stylized and ; it helps the keyboard look cleaner and with less of a gamer aesthetic.

There is a brownish bronze typeface printed on the bottom sides of the keycaps to indicate what keys to use when using the function (Fn) key modifier. It's functional if you plan to stick with the stock Fn layout but aesthetically, I'd prefer if these weren't there.

Thankfully, the Anne Pro 2 is an OEM 60% keyboard layout so it's easier to find replacement keycaps for this board in the future. For now though, I plan on sticking with this stock keycap set for a while.

## Software is really great

The software is very good and is one of the main reasons why I bought the Anne Pro 2.

I'm coming from using a Keychron K2 and my main gripe with that keyboard is that I wasn't able to update the firmware easily. The Anne Pro 2 software makes updating firmware easy and you can also customize your keys with a drag-and-drop interface. It makes for a really flexible experience when tuning this keyboard to your typing style.

For example, I was able to change my Caps Lock key to be a backtick / tilde key instead.

Also, there's a tap layer of functionality that lets you customize how keys should function with a tap. By default, the four bottom-right keys will act as arrow keys on tap and this makes the Anne Pro 2 way easier to transition to if you're used to larger keyboards.
